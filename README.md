# DSIndia_MeetUp_09Mar2019
This is the first event in which I was the speaker, I only approached the organisors to be among the supporting members as I knew the topic and I actually ended up as the speaker and was able to do deliver an awesome talk.
This is the Repo for the MeetUp talk that I gave in Data Science India MeetUp Bangalore
